# Wizard Duels

### This is a group project I made with 2 others as part of the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp.
### We used React.js and Socket.io to create a real time harry potter/pokemon/battleship style multiplayer game.

### Screenshots


### This is the login page that you'll see as soon as the game is loaded. Dumbledore gives you instructions and you can enter a username to get started.

### On this page you can choose a character. There are currently 10 characters with 2 different teams, death eaters and Dumbledore's army. Each time you login the character selection is random but you will always be able to choose a wizard from each team.

### This is a brief look at the gameplay. You can choose a spell and it's location to fire at your opponent. There are a variety of animations that accompany the spells.

## Tech used:

### We built this using a React front end, an express server, a Socket.io server and a postgres database.

### If you'd like to run the game, clone the repo and run npm install in each of the folders (react-front-end, express-back-end and socket-server). Then run npm start in each folder (you'll need 3 terminals running) and go to localhost:3000 on your machine.
