## Wizard Duels!!

This was a group project that I worked on for my final project in the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp.

Myself and 2 others decded to build a game using React and WenSockets. It's a blend of pokemon/battleship/Harry Potter and ended up being a lot of fun. We built everything from scratch (including spell/ character animations) and ended up pushing our knowledge of web development to the limit.
